# Alfred Workflow for Quick Translation

## Motivation

Have you ever found yourself repeatedly copying text while reading, opening Google Translate in your browser, and pasting the text just to get a quick translation?

This workflow simplifies that process. With this Alfred Workflow, you only need to select the text and hit a hotkey. Your browser will open with the selected text already translated. This not only saves time but also streamlines your workflow.

## Installation

1. **Download the Workflow**: [Translate Selection.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/david206/alfred-workflow-translate-selection/blob/main/Transalate%20Selection.alfredworkflow)
2. **Import the Workflow**: Double-click the downloaded file to import it into Alfred.

## Setup

1. **Set the Hotkey**:
   - Open Alfred Preferences (`⌘ + ,`).
   - Go to the "Workflows" tab.
   - Find the "Translate Selection" workflow.
   - Click on the hotkey trigger box and press your desired hotkey combination (e.g., `⌥ + ⌘ + h`).

## Usage

1. **Select Text**: Highlight the text you want to translate.
2. **Hit the Hotkey**: Press the hotkey you configured.
3. **Translation**: Your browser will open with Google Translate, displaying your selected text and its translation.
